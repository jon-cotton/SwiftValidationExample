# Swift Validation Example
An example app to show the [Swift Validation](https://github.com/joncottonskyuk/SwiftValidation) library in use.  A basic example app, that I'm hoping to expand upon, to practice the usage of the Swift Validation lib and provide working examples to help document the usage of the lib.

## Dependencies
[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage)

## Installation
Clone the repo, then run `carthage update --platform ios` from the root of the project
